# JS Array Functions

Not really next-gen JavaScript, but also important: JavaScript array functions like map() , filter() , reduce() etc.

You'll see me use them quite a bit since a lot of React concepts rely on working with arrays (in immutable ways).

The following page gives a good overview over the various methods you can use on the array prototype - feel free to click through them and refresh your knowledge as required: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
